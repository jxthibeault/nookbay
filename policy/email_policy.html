        <h1>User Email Policy</h1>
        <p>The privacy and safety of our users is very important to us. That's
        why we handle your personal information as if it were our own.

        We do not currently require users to register with an email address when
        signing up for nookBay. However, some users may choose to provide one as
        means of contact or for use with future service enhancements.

        When you provide your email address to us, it is encrypted using a
        cryptographically secure, input-oriented algorithm before being saved to
        our servers.

        Your email address is also unable to be read or accessed directly by
        any of our service administrators or moderators.
